Elasticsearch mode for Emacs
============================

Provides a major mode for editing ES curl examples. Better highlighting and
indention than sh-mode or js-mode.

Installation
=============

Don't install this yet. I'm still working on it.

Usage
=====

```elisp
(require 'es-mode)
(es-mode)
```

Or open a file with a `.es` extension.

Example
-------

See `test.es`, here's a screenshot from my theme:

Feedback
========

This is my first major mode for Emacs, feedback is welcome, especially pull
requests that show me what I'm doing wrong.
